# WordGame for iOS

- How much time was invested

About 4 hours.

- How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)

The game is very small so I decided to use a minimal architecture pattern MV ([see more about MV]()). Definitely if the application had more layers, network, data storage, etc. and each of these parts need to be tested, a more natural choice would have been MVVM.

- Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game



- Decisions made because of restricted time

Better UI, Animations,

- What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time

Animations
